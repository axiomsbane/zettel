## 🔁 Connect Markdown to AnkiDroid  
For language learning, I’d love to automate the process of feeding new vocabulary and example sentences into AnkiDroid.  
The goal is to:

- Use a script (probably via [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/))  
- Set up a cron job to sync them to a specific deck regularly  

A small system, but one that would compound benefits over time.

- Install [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)  
- Enjoy clean browsing across all devices on the network
