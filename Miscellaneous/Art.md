# Art That Will Always Stay With Me

*Tuesday, May 20th, 2025*

As I prepare my meal in the kitchen, thinking about how much protein mushrooms must contain, out of nowhere the *Gatsu* theme from *Berserk* plays in my mind. The name **“The Struggler”**, as Guts was called throughout the manga, made me think of all the humans on this planet busy in their daily struggles.

The sudden reappearance of *Berserk* in my mind made me realize just how deeply I was affected by the manga. I take this as proof of how good it really is. I don’t usually think about *Berserk*, but the feelings it made me feel while reading it were apparently stored away in some deep corner of my mind.

This little moment inspired me to note down some of the media that has impacted me throughout my life.

## 1. *The Big Lebowski*

I've read and seen a lot of content on different types of mysticism (albeit not very deeply). Be it **Advaita Vedanta** from Hinduism, **Sufi** philosophers like *Ibn al-Arabi* from Al-Andalus, **Christian mysticism**, **Daoism**, **Buddhism**, and maybe a couple of others—these all share a common thread: they emphasize *sageliness*.

All of them attempt to understand and make sense of our universe, and how one ought to live in it. For modern times, the way of *The Dude* seems to make the most sense.

> **What is the “way of The Dude,” you ask?**  
> Well, how about you figure it out by watching the movie yourself. :)

Here are a few memorable quotes from the film:

- “This aggression will not stand, man.”
- “The Dude abides.”
- “Yeah, well, you know, that’s just, like, your opinion, man.”
- “Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.” *(In response to “How’s it goin’?”)*
- “I can't be worrying about that shit. Life goes on, man.”

The Dude is a modern-day sage. He can’t be bothered by complex—uh… y’know.  
Sorry, I lost my train of thought there.  

Keep it simple, man, because life goes on. There are gonna be strikes and gutters, but you gotta abide and take it easy.

The Coen Brothers were able to capture something very, very special with this film. And it doesn’t hurt that Jeff Bridges is a Buddhist in real life.

All in all, this is an absolutely **S-tier** movie that I would recommend to everyone.

## 2. *No Country for Old Men*

Wowsiee! Yet another Coen Brothers film. I have to admit that I haven’t watched this movie as many times as *The Big Lebowski*. Nonetheless, it’s oddly calm for how violent it is.

The opening monologue narrated by Tommy Lee Jones’ character resonates so strongly with me—it’s my favorite part of the film. The movie deals with perennial themes of trying to understand the changing world and the indifference of the universe toward good and evil.

As I grow older (hell, I’m only in my mid-20s), I can feel how the sheriff must feel—and how my grandparents feel—about the current state of the world. It’s always a pleasure to hear tales from the old-timers, as the sheriff says.

And by *old-timers*, I mean the people of the previous generation. Tales of carefree days out in the mountains and outdoors, climbing trees, eating mangoes, and so on. Having grown up in a city, I never got to experience the kinds of things my father and his generation did.

As the old-timers reminisce about their good old days, my generation is already old enough to have started recounting the days of old—the days when the internet wasn’t as big and there was a sense of wonder about things. Now, everything worth documenting has been documented on the internet, and it’s a wasteland ravaged by bots and advertisements.

In our timeline, the internet truly took a dystopic direction.

This might read like an incoherent ramble, having started by establishing that I like *No Country for Old Men*. However, all of these feelings related to the changing world really do relate to the themes of the movie—*in my view at least*.

At the end, one has to come to terms with the fact that the workings of the world are far too complex to keep up with and make sense of as one grows old. And you say:

> “Okay, I’ll be a part of this world.”

## 4. *Boards of Canada* 

Boards of Canada is a duo that makes electronic music. They're known for their use of obscure sound samples and hidden messages. I hope that I someday get a chance to meet someone who appreciates this sort of music. Its difficult to express in words the feelings evoked by their music. Anywho, I think the only thing I can write down are some of my favorites of theirs and the imagery they invoke in my head: 

- [**Olson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpxCkYX8vHQ) : Unending fields of grass with large white clouds in the sky. Its sunny but not too much due to passing clouds.
- [**Palace Posy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov0FAPhRK0c) : Think of a large mechanical thing, something like in Howl's Moving castle. Its post-apocalyptic and the mechanical giant is trodding along, pistons moving up and down, smoke coming out the exhaust pipe. 
- [**Constants are Changing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI_BI0FlhMM) : You're 5 years old, its a Sunday and you're out on a beautiful picnic with your family. Its a comfortable late summer day but the clouds are coming in and its getting darker. A strong breeze blows and as you sit on the picnic bench, you look towards the trees at the edge of the woods and they're swaying vigorously. 
- [**You Could Feel The Sky**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFNq9bxm_-Q) : You find yourself in the woods, but you have no idea how you got there. Its dawn and you have no clue where to go, so you walk in the direction of a faint light. Its rhythmic and getting louder. You peek through the bushes and its an opening in the woods and people are dancing around a big fire and singing. The air is getting heavier. You wake up from the nightmare, sweating. Phew! It was just a dream.

## 5. *Plaid*

Similar to Boards of Canada, Plaid are also an electronic music duo. Although, their music definitely feels more abstract as compared to BoC. They composed the music for an anime film called Tekkonkinkreet and it contained two of my favorites of theirs. Namely, ["This City"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQiphYqJoY8) and ["White's Dream"](https://youtu.be/JQiphYqJoY8?si=NrJMjx1qq5ape34A&t=3099). Its a shame that this soundtrack is not available on Spotify.
