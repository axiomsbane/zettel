# Zettel Home

This is meant to be a collection of notes and essays on just about anything. The primary reason is to improve my writing skills. I've been a long time admirer of people who write blogs and write stuff just for the love of it. A couple of examples would be : [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/) and [abhinavsarkar.net](https://abhinavsarkar.net/). While I would have liked to have created a bespoke website like theirs, I just don't have the patience and tenacity to create one (Also I would have to deal with styling the website which I absolutely suck at). 

Hence, this is a ready-made Zettelkasten generated by [this template](https://github.com/srid/emanote-template). You can read more about [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca) or the author [srid.ca](https://srid.ca/).
